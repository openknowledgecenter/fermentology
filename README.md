# fermentology

What is it
---
Fermentology wa/is a series of lectures facilitated through the Dunn Lab and Applied Ecology department at NC State. This library-led project is to capture and recontextualize the lecture series in a web/published book-ish thing, in order to extend the content, engage new audiences, and model a new form of communicated, public scholarship.

This project is primarily useful to the library as an example of a thing that looks like “21st century extension” or “community-engaged scholarship,” and the library's role in the production and dissemination of open knowledge and public scholarship.

Project primary output: (codename The Starter)
