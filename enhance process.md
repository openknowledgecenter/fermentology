Process for enriching a talk in Fermentology PubPub
===
BEFORE PUBPUB
---
- transcripts come from the library's 3Play Media account → 3 versions are created (Plain txt file, Html, Srt with time encoded/encrypted for Youtube) but we use the txt file for now
- transcripts go in Google Drive Folder: Materials for PubPub

LOGIN TO PUBPUB
---
Within PubPub: 
- Click: Create a Pub 
- Click (+): Add to Collection
- Select: Book
- Click (+): Add to Collection
- Select a secondary "______ Essays" collection. Ex. Wild Sourdough's secondary category is "Bread Essays."
- Add Title: “ __________________”
- Chapter Title comes from Fermentology Mini-Seminar titles; a subtitle may also be helpful
- Description comes from Fermentology Mini-Seminar website (max 280 characters). Edit description to read more like a subtitle
- Add Contributor → name of Mini-Seminar leader
- Add Affiliation from Mini-Seminar Page. If an Affiliation is unclear, feel free to leave blank
- Search if the author/creator has an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/); if they do, add it to affiliation also
- In Pub Settings: 1) add the date of Mini-Seminar Talk, 2) add a Preview Image, 3) set Text style to "Black Blocks" or "White Blocks." Click "Save changes" in the upper right hand corner of the settings page.
- Add a image attribution for the header image after the abstract following this format: **Creator Name, LICENSE (hyperlinked), via Wikimedia Commons (hyperkinked to image)**

TEXT
---
- at the top of the pub, add the following editors note (italicized): 
- - Editors note: _This publication contains the video of the talk from the Fermentology webinar series, as well as a lightly edited transcript of the lecture. The transcript has been enriched with media, annotations, and links to other material by the digital publication team in order to amplify and extend the content for a reading experience._
- Add "Abstract" (H1) - paste in the talk description from Fermentology Mini-Seminar website
- Add "Watch the talk" (H2) - paste in Youtube talk using pubpub's media feature
- Add horizontal line to separate the Abstract and Video from the transcript 
- Copy and Paste the transcript into the pub
- edit the text/transcript to make it less talky, more read-y without changing the gist of it (this may take approx. an hour or two)
- refer to the prexisting Fermentology "Enriched Talks" as models 
- re-read the transcript 2-3 times and make edits as you go (this can be done as you work on adding images/media)
- add bullet-points and lists as needed for clarity 
- as you work through the text, use the discussion/comment feature in Pubpub to make notations about where media could/should be added or referenced
- add headings/subheads as makes sense- add block quotes as makes sense (aim for 1-2 per talk, not more than 3) 
- link to external research or resources mentioned using pubpub's citations feature, hyperlinks, or footnotes. Should be at least one link per paragraph. Attempt to always link to open access resources. With footnotes and citations, be sure to not highlight a phrase or word, but rather place them at the end of a phrase or word as you can accidentally delete things.
- For each scientific term add a footnote to a taxonomic reference identifier. Do a search in [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q719725) or wikispecies to begin, and typically Encylcopedia of Life, [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), or the iNaturalist Taxon are great resources to link to.

MULTIMEDIA
---
- identify several places where an image might be useful. Decide if that should be a photo, data viz, table, youtube video, podcast, maps, Tweets, etc. 
- try to break up long sections of text with an image or piece of media (aim for a piece of media every 2-3 paragraphs)
- try to differentiate your media - try to avoid using exlcusively static images/photos only
- for one image: try to use an interactive display if possible
- for two + images: use a gallery-style display using google slides
- for all media: include citation/attribution in caption, with the title hyperlinked (rather than the link displayed as text)
- source media from:
  * Library of Congress
  * Europeana
  * DPLA
  * NC State digital archives
  * wikimedia
  * Flickr (triple check copyrights before using)
  * Internet Archive
  * HathiTrust
  * [UN FAO](http://www.fao.org/home/en/)
  * Encyclopedia Britannica --> especially for image galleries
  * more goes here
  
- If there is a data viz to create, check with Micah to see if DVS can work on it. 
- If you need to create an infographic, check with Kelsey to make one or make one with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). 
- embed media using [Storiiies](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/), [KnightLabs tools](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/), or directly in PubPub.

POST-PUBLICATION
===

COMMENTARY
---
*This is an optional step that we may experiment with in partnership with the Author/Creator. The idea here is to have a public conversation integrated with the text itself, adding new insights, research, media, etc. We'll only move into this step if we have the Author/Creator on board to do it also.*

- Using PubPub's features (footnotes, discussion/annotations) add a new layer of commentary to the text. This is where we can pull in other scholarly public resources, natgeo, NYT, Discovery channel, wikimedia/pedia/data, etc. etc. (this may take approx. an hour)
- Always link back to the speakers research (papers, website) when possible
